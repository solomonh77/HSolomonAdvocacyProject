<h2 class= "theVarioustabs"> History</h2>
<p>The banning of books in the United States leads back to colonialism when certain religious books were banned. One example is the book "The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption" by William Pynchon. This book was against the Puritan Calvinists who believed only a few predestined people chosen by God would make it to heaven. Pynchon believed that anyone who believed in God and practiced and followed his teachings would make it into heaven. This took place in 1637 in what is currently known as Massachusetts. Pynchon's pamphlet was burned and banned and today only 4 copies exist. This example alone is not the event of book banning in history. This is only one example of many instances of banned books throughout history. <br>
There was a case in 1976 at Island Trees Union Free School District where a school wanted and did ban 9 books because they claimed to be "anti-American, anti-semitic, and just plain filthy." It is reasonable to see how this specific time period would describe how individuals felt about this topic but this was not how the overall general public went. This was taken to the Supreme Court as Board of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico, where the Supreme Court addressed the removal of books in public school libraries. The Supreme Court decided that schools can not ban books soley based on their content unless they are "pervasively vulgar or educationally unsuitable."

      <div class= "theProblem">
        <h2 class="theVarioustabs"> The Problem </h2>
<p> Book banning occurs when a group of individuals usually of higher authority attempt and succeed in removing books from their library. These books get banned because these individuals don't agree with the content, themes, and messages of the books. Book banning is considered the largest form of censorship because it is mostly targeted at children. Adults and parents fear that the content of these books will impact their children's beliefs in a negative way. These books may raise the children to ask unwarranted questions to the parents. But isn't that what children are supposed to be doing... asking questions? The books that are banned range from various subjects, they could be fantasy books, LGBTQ+ books, dystopian books, violence-filled books, or even books about BLM and activism in general. Although everyone can agree some of these titles are inappropriate for children and teens, there is nothing wrong with providing these books to students in the library. There are various reasons why books are banned. When researching this topic, the ones that popped up were related to school. Some of the common genres that are banned are fantasy books, LGBTQ+ books, books about BLM/activism, and dystopian novels. </p>
      </div>
      <div class= "why">
        <h2 class="theVarioustabs"> Why Is It A Problem? </h2>
        <p> The problem with book banning is that society is trying to push more of one belief than another. When restricting access to various materials or different perspectives, you restrict others from the opportunity to learn about these views. This also has a great effect on the education curriculum. Students will have a harder time developing empathy with each other if diverse opinions and people are not represented in the curriculum. By including these diverse books, you don't only see and learn about the different people who you could come across in your life, you learn to grow your own beliefs and values. In addition, the representation from these books helps minorities feel welcomed and seen. The banning of certain books may make one parent happy, but it takes away the opportunity of another child. </p> </div>

        <li> During this school year, instances of book banning are most prevalent in Texas, Florida, Missouri, Utah, and South Carolina. T</li>
        <li> A 2022 poll found that 70% of respondents are against the banning of books</li>
        <li> In this six-month period (in 2023), 30% of the books banned were about racism, race, or include characters of color. In addition, 26% of these banned titles have characters who are part of the LGBTQ+ community or the themes of the community. </li>
        <li> During the first half of the 2022-2023 school year, PEN America found 1,477 individual instances of banned books. This was a 28 percent increase compared to January - June 2022.</li>

<p> This image is an infographic about censored books in 2019. The infographic includes testimonies, pie graphs, word clouds, and more to present their argument. This infographic was provided by ala.org. </p>
<p> There is a lot of impact banned books have on individuals around the world. Since the majority of books that are banned are about minorities, there is a lack of representation within the book industry that puts individuals at risk. From my own experience, reading a book where the main character is white is very different than reading a book where the main character is black. Although to some it is just a skin color, this is a lived experience for others. </p>
